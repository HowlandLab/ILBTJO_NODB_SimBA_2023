This repository contains data and documentation associated with "High-THC Cannabis smoke impairs working memory capacity in spontaneous tests of novelty preference for objects and odors in rats" (Barnard & Onofrychuk). Specifically, this repository contains project folders assocaiated with classifiers for predicting rat-stimulus interaction for object- and odor-based stimuli, with representative visualizations of model outputs. For files that exceed GitHub file size limits, links to Google Docs folders are provided.

In brief, this project aimed to assess the effects of acute Cannabis exposure on working memory in rats. Here, working memory was inferred by novelty preference on spontaneous interaction tasks with different types (objects and odors) of stimuli. To quantify rat-stimulus interaction, we applied open source pose-estimation (DeepLabCut) and behavioural classification (SimBA) software. This README document will visualize outputs from this pipeline and direct readers to necessary data to reproduce our results. A more detailed summary of our methods and performance metrics can be found in the supplementary materials associated with the manuscript preprint (DOI: ).

For both classifiers, we generated pose-estimation data using a single DLC network where eight points of interest were labelled in accordance with the SimBA single animal eight-point configuration.
